A simple test bed and example for SDL2 + OpenGL via glad + NanoVG ( + stb_image/truetype) on Windows with VS2015.

Not really useful (yet).

Assumes an in-tree VC build of SDL is present at nvgsdldemo/../SDL

The rest (glad-generated stuff, nanovg) is included either in the source tree or as a submodule.
